My Hobby Website Report


This report outlines the design and implementation of a sports-themed website developed as part of an assignment. The website features three main pages: the homepage showcasing my love for sports, a page dedicated to my top three sports (basketball, hockey, soccer), and a page highlighting my favorite teams for each sport. Additionally, a contact page is included to facilitate communication. The website utilizes HTML5 and CSS for structure and styling, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.

Color Scheme:

The color scheme selected for the website consists of blue and white with accents of dark shades. The primary colors used are:
Background Color: Light Grey
Header and Footer Background: Dark Blue 
Text Color: Dark Grey 
Accent Color: White 

I chose these colors because they represent the colors of my favorite teams. The Toronto Raptors primary colors are red and white and so I chose white because it is a common color between the 3 teams. The Toronto Maple Leafs are my favorite team and their primary color is blue and white so the website is primarily themed based off them. Real Madridâ€™s primary colors are blue, gold and red with white also being one. Again blue and white is a big part of Real Madrid which is also the theme of the website.

Multimedia Elements
Multimedia elements, such as images and videos, are embedded to enrich the user experience. The gallery section on the homepage features images related to basketball, hockey, and soccer, while the videos section includes clips showcasing my favorite moments from each sport. These elements make the website more engaging and dynamic.




Forms and Inputs
The contact page includes a simple form with inputs for the user's name, email, and message. This form allows users to get in touch easily and demonstrates the use of HTML form elements and basic validation.


Theme and Creativity
The thematic consistency is maintained throughout the website by using a cohesive color scheme and a clean, modern design. The layout is simple yet effective, ensuring that the focus remains on the content. Creativity is showcased through the use of multimedia elements and interactive features like hover effects.
Conclusion
The sports-themed website successfully meets the requirements of the assignment by providing a clear and organized structure, visually appealing design, and engaging content. The chosen colors and coding techniques enhance the user experience, making the website both functional and aesthetically pleasing. This project demonstrates a solid understanding of HTML5 and CSS, along with effective design principles.
